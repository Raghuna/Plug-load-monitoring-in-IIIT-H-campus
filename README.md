A partial inventory of the MELs available at the International Institute of Information 
Technology-Hyderabad Vindya building was prepared. 93 devices were selected to be 
monitored by random sampling. Devices high in energy consumption and high usage 
variability were chosen for the study. The devices for the preliminary study belong to the 
following five categories: Display, Computer, Imaging, Networking and Other 
appliances. Display category includes different types of LCD, LED and Desktop 
monitors. Computer category includes different types of laptops, integrated PC and 
desktop CPUs. All kinds of printers, scanners, copiers, projectors are included in imaging 
category. Networking category includes devices like routers and switches. All the 
remaining plug load devices such as ovens, refrigerators, water coolers etc. are in 
“Others” category. The devices are metered for a period of four months. 
Some devices were not used by the users and the data was not available for these devices.
